# WORKING WITH TUPLES
- Like lists, tuples are data structure that can contain multiple items.
- Tuples are immutable, meaning once created, their contents cannot be changed.
- Tuples are defined using parentheses `()` instead of square brackets `[]`.
- Syntax:
    my_tuple = (item1, item2, item3, ...)


##### Acessing Tuple Elements
my_tuple[Index]

- Unlike lists, tuples do not support item assignment.
- Once a tuple is created we can't add, remove, or set items.
- However, we can access elements using indexing.
