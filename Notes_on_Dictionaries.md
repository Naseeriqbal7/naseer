- Unlike a list, which is an ordered collection of items, a dictionary is an unordered collection of items.
- there's no gurantee that the items in a dictionary remain in the same order.

- In a dictionary, each item consists of a key/value pair where each value in the dictionary is indexed by a unique key.
- synrax:
   dictionary_name = {key1:value1, key2:values2, key3:value3, ...}
   - The key can be any immutable data type, but its usually a string.
