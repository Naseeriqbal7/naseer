# WORKING WITH LISTS
> A list contains a collection of items.

##### The syntax for creating a list
```
my_list = [item1, item2, item3, ...]
```
##### Referring items in a list
- To refer to the items in a list, we use an index, where 0 refers the first item, 1 refers the second item, and 2 refer the third item, and so on.
- We can also use negative values for an index, where -1 refers to the last item, -2 refers to the second last item, and so on.

```
my_list[index]
```
